## Data Types and Operators

### Arithmetic operators

- Addition +
- Subtraction -
- Multiplication *
- Division /
- Mod (the remainder after dividing) %
- Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages) **
- Caret : bitwise XOR ^
- Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer //

The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python, often referred to as 
#### PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

### Assignment Operators

#### In general, there are two types of errors to look out for
 - Exceptions : occurs when the code is running,
 - Syntax : detected when Python checks the code before it runs it.


##### The bool data type holds one of the values True or False, which are often encoded as 1 or 0, respectively.

### String Method
#### format()

#### split()

A helpful string method when working with strings is the .split method. This function or method returns a data container called a list that contains the words from the input string. We will be introducing you to the concept of lists in the next video.

The split method has two additional arguments (sep and maxsplit). The sep argument stands for "separator". It can be used to identify how the string should be split up (e.g., whitespace characters like space, tab, return, newline; specific punctuation (e.g., comma, dashes)). If the sep argument is not provided, the default separator is whitespace.

True to its name, the maxsplit argument provides the maximum number of splits. The argument gives maxsplit + 1 number of elements in the new list, with the remaining string being returned as the last element in the list. You can read more about these methods in the Python documentation too.
